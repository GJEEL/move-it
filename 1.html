		<h1>Move It</h1>
		
		<p>Computer mice are strange creatures. Their stomachs are scraped against your desk surface to let your cursor move.</p>
		
		<p>Usage of a computer mouse requires hand-eye coordination. A failure in movement and control of either the eyes or the hands may severely limit mouse usage.</p>
		
		<p>Repetitive strange injuries are one of many consequences of high amounts of computer activity. This may at least partially be attributed to computer mouse usage.</p>
		
		<p>Other potential ailments from high amounts of computer activity may include carpal tunnel, eyestrain, back pain, depression, suicidal ideation, and other strange effects.</p>
