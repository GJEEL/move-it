		<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
		
			<p>
				This is an experimental art website by a student. This means that it is held together by the hopes and dreams of someone with limited worldly experience.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Any resemblance to real life people, stories, or events is a coincidence. This is not a biographical work. It might not even be a parody.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This website does not record any information because it is a static website with no plug-ins, add-ons, or embeds.
				However, this website's host has traffic analysis. Maybe more than that. Do not assume you are free from data collection.
			</p>
			
			</p>
				This website relies on your device's connection to the internet and your device's ability to download its files.
				By continuing, you are willingly subjecting yourself to this website, its host, your internet service provider, and the light of your screen.
				Whatever happens will happen, and you will not hold Move It liable for anything. At all. Ever.
			</p>

				Move It is not provided under any license.
